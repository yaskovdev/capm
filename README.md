## 9. What is a Project

A temporary endeavor, that produces a unique product, service (non-tangable usually) or result (e.g., a research to test a drug).

Must be temporary, otherwise it's operations (like sales, IT support, accountant, etc.)

Must be unique (compare: the next phone model and an instance of already existing phone).

Progressive elaboration means "as time goes, the things in the project becomes more elaborated". I.e., as time is progressing, the details become more known.

Projects can be part of a larger thing: Program or Portfolio.

## 10. What is Project Management

Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to satisfy project requirements.

Project management, in particular, should:
1. Justify what's the return of the money the company investing in the project.
2. Estimate resources and times.
3. Create a management plan.
4. Lead and motivate the team. That's one of the main tasks. Better to call it people management.
5. Manage risks, issues and changes.
6. Monitor progress against plan.

## 11. What is Program Management

Program -- group of related projects.

A project may not be a part of a program. But a program will always have projects.

Speculation: you need a program when the projects have a lot of interdependencies. Otherwise these can be just normal independent projects.

## 12. What is Portfolio Management
