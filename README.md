# PMI Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM)

## 6. CAPM Exam Topics

See [Examination Content Outline](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/certifications/capm20ecofinal.pdf).

## 9. What is a Project

A temporary endeavor, that produces a unique product, service (non-tangable usually) or result (e.g., a research to test a drug).

Must be temporary, otherwise it's operations (like sales, IT support, accountant, etc.) See paragraph 13.

Must be unique (compare: the next phone model and an instance of already existing phone).

Progressive elaboration means "as time goes, the things in the project becomes more elaborated". I.e., as time is progressing, the details become more known.

Projects can be part of a larger thing: Program or Portfolio.

## 10. What is Project Management

Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to satisfy project requirements.

Project management, in particular, should:
1. Justify what's the return of the money the company investing in the project.
2. Estimate resources and times.
3. Create a management plan.
4. Lead and motivate the team. That's one of the main tasks. Better to call it people management.
5. Manage risks, issues and changes.
6. Monitor progress against plan.

## 11. What is Program Management

Program -- group of related projects.

A project may not be a part of a program. But a program will always have projects.

Speculation: you need a program when the projects have a lot of interdependencies. Otherwise these can be just normal independent projects.

## 12. What is Portfolio Management

Portfolio -- collection of programs. Can also include other portfolios and projects. Allows to achieve strategic goals (long term, 3-5 years or more).

Portfolio managers are often a CEO or people who work directly with the CEO.

## 13. Operations Management

90% of the people likely work in operations.

Operations management manages the resources for these everyday activities.

## 14. What is the value of the project

Increase revenue, decrease expenses, increase brand reputation, make customer service better, new or better service, etc.

## 15. Projects enable changes

You must be willing to change if you want to achive your goals or simply not to die (no matter if you are a person or an organization). Projects are a way to make changes.

## 16. Phases and Deliverables

Deliverable is a result of a project phase. A project phase is a set of activities.

A project also produces deliverables (1 to multiple). A project consists of phases.

Speculation: can be though of as a subproject.

Project manager creates them.

Example: design (produces design doc), code (produces the code), test (produces test results).

Important: deliverables are given to the customer for acceptance.

## 17. Project Life Cycle

Project life cycle is a set of all the phases of the project.

Can be predictive (aka traditional, when you know the scope), adaptive (agile), hybrid.

## 18. Project Governance

Project governance is a framework within which project decisions are made. Based on structure, people and information.

It's unique to an organization.

It helps you make good decisions.


## 19. Stakeholders

People who are affected (or even may be affected) by the project. Very broad term.

May be positively or negatively affected. If you have lost your job because you have been replaced by a new product, you are a stackeholder of the project that delivered that product.

Some of the key stakeholders:
1. PM
2. Customers
3. Project team
4. Project Sponsor
5. Functional Manager. This is who generally controls the resources that you need for your project. Manager of Engineering, Director of IT, Vice President of Marketing, etc. Clashes are possible since they may need resources for other projects. You need to learn conflict management for that.

## 20. Roles of Project Manager

1. Initiator
2. Negotiator
3. Listener
4. Coach (not Dictator)
5. Working member
6. Facilitator (manages group processes and discussions, meetings, in short)

## 21. What are milestones

Significant event or achievement in a project.

Milestone can be thought of as a task with 0 duration.

## 22. Organizational Structures

Depending on the structure, PM has different power.

1. Functional Organization. Team members report directly to a Functional Manager (see 19). PM has very little power.
2. Projectized Organization. Opposite to the above. The team is assigned to a project on a full-time basis.
3. Hybrid of 1 and 2. Some departments are functional, some are projectized.
4. Weak / Balanced / Strong Matrix. These are the transistional forms from 1 to 2 (in a sence of who has the power, PM or FM). Most of the businesses are in one of these categories.

## 23. Project Boss

Either a Sponsor or a Program manager.

You, as a PM, report to one of them.

## 24. Areas of a project

This is the stuff you are managing as a PM.

1. Scope
2. Schedule
3. Cost
4. Quality
5. Resources
6. Communications
7. Risk
8. Procurements
9. Stakeholders' engagement

## 25. Project Management Office

Aka PMO.

Organizational Structure (group of people or sometimes one person) that standardizes the processes and facilitates sharing.

Normally are present in big organizations.

Types:

1. Supportive
2. Controlling
3. Directive. PM is a resource to PMO.

The PMO and Project Governance are interconnected in that the PMO helps implement the project management practices and standards that align with the governance framework established by the organization (see 18). Although normally PMO does not directly build the Project Governance framework. This is rather done by senior executives of the company.
